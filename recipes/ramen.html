    <h1>Ramen Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/ramen.jpg" alt="Image of a bowl of ramen.">
    <p>Easy homemade chicken ramen, with a flavorful broth, roasted
    chicken, fresh veggies, lots of noodles, and a soft cooked egg.
    Inspired by traditional Japanese ramen, but on the table in
    under an hour.</p>
    <p>The Honey’s parents are American ex-pats living abroad in
    Tokyo, Japan, and while visiting them over the last seven
    or eight years, he’s collected dozens of favorite eateries
    throughout the city.</p>
    <p>There’s the best izakaya in Kichijoji, serving up casual 
    Japanese pub food, and countless kiten-zushi restaurants, 
    where my English-speaking Honey can choose small plates 
    of freshly-made sushi from a moving conveyor belt without
    having to order in Japanese.</p>
